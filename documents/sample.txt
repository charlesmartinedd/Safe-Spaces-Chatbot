Sample Document for RAG System

This is a sample document to demonstrate the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities of the AI chatbot.

About RAG:
RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It's a technique that enhances AI responses by first retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base, then using that information to generate more accurate and contextual responses.

How it works:
1. Documents are uploaded to the system
2. They are split into chunks and converted to vector embeddings
3. When a user asks a question, the system searches for relevant chunks
4. The AI uses these chunks as context to generate a response

Benefits:
- More accurate responses based on your specific documents
- Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in real data
- Allows the AI to answer questions about your proprietary information
- Can be updated in real-time by adding or removing documents

Example Questions:
Try asking:
- "What is RAG?"
- "How does the system work?"
- "What are the benefits of using RAG?"

The chatbot will use this document to provide accurate answers!
