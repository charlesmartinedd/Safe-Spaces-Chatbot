The federal government has shut down due to the failures of the President and Congress to continue government funding.
 Millions of Californians receiving benefits from state programs may be impacted. For now, California’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) will continue to provide services and enroll eligible families as long as funding is available. No new federal funding to California WIC will be provided until the President and Congress take action. Families should continue to use their WIC benefits and attend their WIC appointments. This information is subject to change, so please monitor the
 
California WIC website
 for updates.
 

 Please be wary of potential highly partisan political messaging while visiting federal government websites for information related to the federal government shutdown.
